## Happy Birthday!!!

### Wish someone special happy birthday in a special way.


It was a birthday for my girlfriend and I wanted to wish her in a special way. So I put together this animated web page real quick to say Happy Birthday.

Feel free to use it to wish your friend if you want.
You can get it running in a few easy steps:

- Fork the repository
- Open `customize.json` and replace name/wish-message/image with your own
- Turn on GitHub pages for the repository (Settings > GitHub Pages)
- Send the URL that you get at the above step to your friend

I've used plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript with [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap) for animations.
